## Project Overview
- This project is an interactive webpage that tells the story of DÃ­a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) through a series of illustrated pages. Users can navigate through the story, view images, and read about traditions, family memories, and symbolic items associated with the holiday.

- The final page allows users to write a letter to their loved ones, which triggers a floating animation and a confirmation message. Background music and falling marigold petals enhance the immersive experience.
